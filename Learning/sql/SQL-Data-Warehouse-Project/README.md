## Project Title
Modern Data Warehouse with SQL Server.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in SQL development, data architecture, data engineering, ETL pipelines, data modeling, and data analytics.

## Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## Data Model

The data model is designed to support the following business requirements:

- **Customer Behavior**: Analyze customer demographics, purchase history, and preferences.
- **Product Performance**: Track product sales, inventory, and performance metrics.
- **Sales Trends**: Monitor sales trends over time to identify patterns and make informed decisions.

## Data Engineering

The data engineering process includes:
- **Data Ingestion**: Import data from CSV files into SQL Server.
- **Data Cleansing**: Resolve data quality issues and ensure data consistency.
- **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple sources into a single, user-friendly data model.
- **Data Modeling**: Design a star schema for efficient data analysis.

## Analytics and Reporting
The analytics and reporting process includes:
- **SQL-based Analytics**: Develop SQL queries to extract insights from the data model.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports and dashboards to visualize key business metrics.
